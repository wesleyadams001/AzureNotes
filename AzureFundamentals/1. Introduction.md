Private and public cloud platform on [[AzureFundamentals]]
	- Azure using virtualization, thsi allows for decoupling via an abstraction layer called hypervisor that replicates all the usual functions of material matchine
	- Each MS data center has multiple rack fille with severs connected with switches that run fabric controllers the switch is connected to a device called an orchestrator that creates relevant items and sends them to fabric controlers
