## Deploy and Configure Servers, Instances, and Databases for Azure SQL
[[AzureSQLFundamentals]]

After you've selected a workload to either migrate to or create in Azure SQL, you need to plan your deployment, deploy accordingly, and verify that the deployment was successful. In this unit, you'll learn various methods for each step in the process.

## Pre-deployment planning

Before you start deploying things in Azure, it's important to understand what your requirements are and how they map to offerings in Azure SQL. Using what you learned in the Azure SQL introduction module, it's time to make a plan. You need to answer the following questions:

-   Deployment method: Azure portal or command-line interface?
-   Deployment option: virtual machine (VM), database, elastic pool, managed instance, or instance pool?
-   Purchasing model (Azure SQL Database only): DTU or vCore?
-   Service tier: General Purpose, Business Critical, or Hyperscale?
-   Hardware: Gen5, or something new?
-   Sizing: number of vCores and **Data max size**?

In addition, and perhaps before answering the preceding questions, you need to pick a workload that's going to either be migrated to Azure SQL or be "born in the cloud." If you're migrating, many tools and resources are available to help you plan, assess, migrate, and optimize your databases and application. Resources are provided at the end of this module.

### Resource limits

The Azure SQL introduction module described limits, rates, and capabilities (like IOPS or in-memory OLTP).But there are other resource limits that are affected by your choice of Azure SQL Managed Instance, Azure SQL Database, or options within these choices:

-   Memory
-   Max log size
-   Transaction log rate
-   Data IOPS
-   Size of tempdb
-   Max concurrent workers
-   Backup retention

The limits for Azure SQL Managed Instance and Azure SQL Database depend on your choice of purchasing model, service tier, and number of vCores (or DTU in Azure SQL Database only).

Azure SQL Managed Instance and SQL Database are platform as a service (PaaS) offerings. Restricting these choices should not inhibit your ability to fully use a SQL Server managed service.

Within a General Purpose Azure SQL Database instance, your choice of provisioned or serverless compute will also affect these limits. Before deploying, you should review what's included in what you plan to deploy, to ensure that you're starting out with what you need.

It's also important to know that Azure SQL resources have overall resource limits _per subscription_ and _per region_. If you need to increase your limits, it's possible to request a quota increase in the Azure portal.

## Deployment
After you've completed your pre-deployment planning, it's time to put your plan into action. In this stage, you'll deploy Azure SQL (by using the Azure portal or the command line), determine network configuration, and make an initial connection.

For Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance, there are essentially five panes in the Azure portal to fill in during a deployment.

Let's dive into a few of these options.
### Server

When you create an Azure SQL managed instance, supplying the server name is the same as in SQL Server. But for databases and elastic pools, an Azure SQL Database server is required. This is a _logical_ server that acts as a central administrative point for a single or pooled database. It includes logins, firewall rules, auditing rules, threat detection policies, and failover groups. (You'll learn more about these topics later.)

This logical server does not expose any instance-level access or features as with Azure SQL Managed Instance. For Azure SQL Database servers, the server name must be unique across all of Azure.

### Compute and storage

In the previous module of this learning path, you learned about options and recommendations for compute and storage, including service tiers, purchasing models, and hardware generations. You'll have to select the desired configuration during deployment. You also must determine the number of vCores and **Data max size**.

Generally, if you're migrating, you should use size that's similar to what you use on-premises. You can also use tools, like the Data Migration Assistant SKU recommender, to estimate the number of vCores and **Data max size** based on your current workload.

**Data max size** is not necessarily the size of your data today. It's the maximum amount of data space that can be allocated for your database. It will also help you understand the allocation of log space, which scales with **Data max size**.

### Networking configuration

Choices for networking for Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance are different. When you deploy a SQL database, currently the default is **No access**.

You can then choose to select a public endpoint or private endpoint. In the exercise that follows this unit, you'll use the public endpoint and set the **Allow Azure services and resources to access this server** option to yes, meaning that other Azure services (for example, Azure Data Factory or Azure Virtual Machines) can access the database if you configure it. You can also select **Add current client IP address** if you want to be able to connect from the IP address from the client computer that you used to deploy Azure SQL Database.

With Azure SQL Managed Instance, you deploy it inside an Azure virtual network and a subnet that's dedicated to managed instances. This enables you to have a secure, private IP address. Azure SQL Managed Instance provides the ability to connect an on-premises network to a managed instance, connect a managed instance to a linked server or other on-premises data store, and connect a managed instance to other resources.

You can also enable a public endpoint so you can connect to a managed instance from the internet without a virtual private network (VPN). This access is disabled by default.

### Data source

In Azure SQL Database, upon deployment you have the option to select the AdventureWorksLT database as the sample in the Azure portal. In Azure SQL Managed Instance, you deploy the instance first and then databases inside it, so there's no option to have the sample database upon deployment (similar to SQL Server). You can learn more about the AdventureWorks sample databases on GitHub.

You can also deploy a blank database or create a database that's based on the restore from a geo-replicated backup.

### Database collations

Collations in SQL Server and Azure SQL tell the database engine how to treat certain characters and languages. A collation provides the sorting rules, case, and accent sensitivity properties for your data.

When you're creating a new SQL database or managed instance, it's important to first take into account the locale requirements of the data you're working with. The reason is that the collation set will affect the characteristics of many operations in the database. In the SQL Server box product, the default collation is typically determined by the OS locale.

In Azure SQL Managed Instance, you can set the server collation upon creation of the instance. It can't be changed later. The server collation sets the default for all of the databases in that instance of Azure SQL Managed Instance, but you can modify the collations on a database and column level.

In Azure SQL Database, you can't set the server collation. It's set at the default (and most common) collation of `SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS`, but you can set the database collation. If we break that into chunks:

-   `SQL` means it's a SQL Server collation (as opposed to a Windows or binary collation).
-   `Latin1_General` specifies the alphabet/language to use when sorting.
-   `CP1` references the code page that the collation uses.
-   `CI` means it will be case-insensitive. `CS` would mean case-sensitive.
-   `AS` means it will be accent-sensitive. `AI` would mean accent-insensitive.

Other options are available. Examples are character widths and UTF-8 encoding. You can find more details about what you can and can't do with Azure SQL in the documentation. (Search for "collation and unicode support.")

### Opt-in for Azure Defender

When you deploy Azure SQL Database in the portal, you're prompted about whether you want to enable Azure Defender in a free trial. Select **Start free trial**. After the free trial, it's billed according to the Azure Security Center Standard Tier pricing.

After you enable it, you get functionality related to identifying/mitigating potential database vulnerabilities and threat detection. You'll learn more about these capabilities in the next security module of this learning path.

In Azure SQL Managed Instance, you can enable Azure Defender on the instance after deployment.

### Review of selections

On the **Review and create** pane, you can review your deployment selections and the Azure Marketplace terms.

 Tip

You also have the **Download a template for automation** option. This unit doesn't cover that method. If you're interested, there are other modules available on Microsoft Learn related to Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates.

## Key deployment implementation details

While Azure is taking care of the deployment for you, there are some deployment implementation details that you should be aware of. All of the services are built on the Azure backbone known as _Azure Service Fabric_. Understanding the back end of how some of these services are deployed and scaled on Azure Service Fabric will help you understand various behaviors that you might see.

### Azure SQL Managed Instance

Behind the scenes, for Azure SQL Managed Instance, Azure deploys a dedicated ring (sometimes called a _virtual cluster_) for your service. This architecture helps in providing security and native virtual network support.

Because of this architecture, deployment and scaling operations can take longer. For example, when you scale up or down, Azure deploys a new virtual cluster for you and then seeds it with your data. You can think of every instance as running on a single virtual machine.

Azure SQL Instance pools were introduced to help with the long deployment time. You can pre-deploy a "pool" of dedicated resources. Deploying into a pool and scaling within a pool are faster than traditional deployments. (And you get a higher packing density, because you can deploy multiple instances within a single VM.)

### Azure SQL Database

Azure SQL Database is contained by a logical database server. In most cases, a SQL database is hosted by a dedicated SQL Server instance, but you don't have to worry about managing the instance.

The logical database server gives you something to connect to. It also enables you to group and manage certain permissions and configurations together. Within each logical database server is a logical master database, which can provide instance-level diagnostics.

### Azure SQL Database - Hyperscale

The Hyperscale tier within Azure SQL Database (not available in Azure SQL Managed Instance) has a unique architecture for Azure SQL. The Azure SQL team rearchitected Hyperscale for the cloud, and this architecture includes a multilayer caching system that can help with both speed and scale. Scaling and other operations no longer become related to the size of data and can be completed in constant time (a matter of minutes). The use of remote storage also allows for snapshot backups.

In a subsequent module of the learning path about Azure SQL fundamentals, you'll learn more details related to the architecture and how it affects performance and availability. One consideration during the deployment phase is that after you move a database to the Hyperscale tier, you can't "go back" to the General Purpose or Business Critical tier.

### Resource governance

As you increase or decrease the resources in a service tier, the limits for dimensions such as CPU, storage, memory, and more might change up to a certain threshold. Although there's a multifaceted approach to governance in Azure SQL, the following three technologies are primarily used to govern your usage of resources in Azure SQL:

-   Windows job objects allow a group of processes to be managed and governed as a unit. Job objects are used to govern the file's virtual memory commit, working set caps, CPU affinity, and rate caps. You can use the `sys.dm_os_job_object` dynamic management view to see the limits in place.
-   Resource Governor is a SQL Server feature that helps users (and in this case, Azure) govern resources like CPU, physical I/O, and memory. Azure SQL Managed Instance also allows user-defined workload groups and pools for Resource Governor.
-   File Server Resource Manager is available in Windows Server and is used to govern file directory quotas, which are used to manage **Data max size**.

Additional implementations to govern transaction log rate are built into the database engine for Azure, through _transaction log rate governance_. This process limits high ingestion rates for workloads such as `BULK INSERT`, `SELECT INTO`, and index builds. They're tracked and enforced as the subsecond level. They currently scale within a service tier linearly.
