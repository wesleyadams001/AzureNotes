## Deploy and Configure Servers, Instances, and Databases for Azure SQL
[[AzureSQLFundamentals]]

After you've selected a workload to either migrate to or create in Azure SQL, you need to plan your deployment, deploy accordingly, and verify that the deployment was successful. In this unit, you'll learn various methods for each step in the process.

## Pre-deployment planning

Before you start deploying things in Azure, it's important to understand what your requirements are and how they map to offerings in Azure SQL. Using what you learned in the Azure SQL introduction module, it's time to make a plan. You need to answer the following questions:

-   Deployment method: Azure portal or command-line interface?
-   Deployment option: virtual machine (VM), database, elastic pool, managed instance, or instance pool?
-   Purchasing model (Azure SQL Database only): DTU or vCore?
-   Service tier: General Purpose, Business Critical, or Hyperscale?
-   Hardware: Gen5, or something new?
-   Sizing: number of vCores and **Data max size**?

In addition, and perhaps before answering the preceding questions, you need to pick a workload that's going to either be migrated to Azure SQL or be "born in the cloud." If you're migrating, many tools and resources are available to help you plan, assess, migrate, and optimize your databases and application. Resources are provided at the end of this module.
